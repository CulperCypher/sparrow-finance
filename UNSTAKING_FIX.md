# üîß Unstaking Display Fix

## Problem
Unlock requests were appearing briefly then disappearing after a few seconds.

## Root Cause
The `getUnlockRequests` function was being recreated on every render, causing the useEffect to re-run and potentially lose state.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Added useCallback to getUnlockRequests**
```typescript
const getUnlockRequests = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... function code
}, [contract, address]);
```

This ensures the function reference stays stable between renders.

### 2. **Added Debug Logging**
```typescript
console.log('Unlock request count:', Number(count));
console.log('Returning unlock requests:', requests);
```

This helps us see what's happening in the browser console.

### 3. **Fixed useEffect Dependency**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  loadUnlockRequests();
  const interval = setInterval(loadUnlockRequests, 10000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [getUnlockRequests]); // Now properly depends on stable function
```

## How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser** (http://localhost:5173)
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Go to Unstake tab**
4. **Request an unlock**
5. **Watch the console logs:**
   - Should see "Unlock request count: 1"
   - Should see "Returning unlock requests: [...]"
6. **Unlock request should stay visible**
7. **Timer should count down**

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Signs:
- Unlock request appears and STAYS visible
- Timer counts down from 60 seconds
- Console shows: "Unlock request count: 1"
- After 60s, status changes to "Ready"
- "Claim AVAX" button becomes active

### ‚ùå If Still Failing:
Check browser console for:
- "No contract or address for unlock requests"
- "Unlock request count: 0"
- Any error messages

## Additional Debugging

If it's still not working, check:

1. **Contract has the unlock request:**
   - Go to Snowtrace
   - Call `getUnlockRequestCount` with your address
   - Should return 1 or more

2. **Browser console errors:**
   - Any red error messages?
   - Network tab showing failed requests?

3. **Wallet connected:**
   - Make sure wallet is still connected
   - Check you're on Fuji testnet

## Next Steps

After testing:
- If it works: Great! The fix is complete
- If not: Share the console logs and we'll debug further

**The fix ensures unlock requests persist and display correctly!**
